## üß† Prompt Template
Act as a strategic advisor with expertise in decision science. I'm facing this decision: [describe decision/situation].

Help me analyze this using a structured approach:

1. **Frame the Decision**:
   - What exactly are we deciding?
   - What are the stakes and timeline?
   - Who are the key stakeholders?

2. **Generate Options**:
   - What are 3-5 viable alternatives (including "do nothing")?
   - What assumptions does each option rely on?

3. **Evaluation Criteria**:
   - What factors matter most? (e.g., cost, time, risk, strategic fit)
   - How should we weight these criteria?

4. **Analysis**:
   - Score each option against the criteria
   - What are the key trade-offs?
   - What could go wrong with each option?

5. **Recommendation**:
   - Which option do you recommend and why?
   - What would need to be true for a different option to be better?
   - What are the critical next steps and decision points?

Context: [relevant background, constraints, resources]
