## üß™ Example Prompt
> "Act as a policy analysis expert. Analyze this debate: Should businesses provide protected time and training for employees to learn AI skills, or should employees use their own time and motivation to develop these capabilities?
> 
> Context: We're a mid-size professional services firm (500 employees) facing rapid AI adoption in our industry. Competitors are moving quickly, but we have budget constraints and billable hour targets. Our workforce ranges from digital natives to those nearing retirement. The industry is shifting toward AI-augmented service delivery within 2-3 years.
>
