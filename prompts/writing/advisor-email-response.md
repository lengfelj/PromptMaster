## üß† Prompt Template
Act as an experienced business advisor and board member with expertise in corporate governance and stakeholder communications. Help me respond to this email from [company name] where I serve as [role: advisor/board member/consultant].

**Context**:
- My role: [specific title, formal/informal advisor, board member, consultant]
- Relationship duration: [new relationship, established, long-term]
- Current engagement: [active project, periodic check-ins, formal meetings only]
- Email sender: [CEO, founder, team member - their role and relationship to you]
- Email topic: [paste key points or full email]

**Response Framework**:

1. **Tone Calibration**:
   - Professional yet approachable
   - Appropriate to sender's seniority and your relationship
   - Balances authority with collaboration

2. **Content Structure**:
   - Acknowledge their message and any urgency
   - Provide strategic insight without overstepping
   - Clarify boundaries if needed
   - Offer specific value within your role
   - Set clear next steps or expectations

3. **Key Considerations**:
   - Liability limitations (avoid specific operational decisions)
   - Time boundaries (availability and response expectations)
   - Confidentiality requirements
   - Other stakeholder dynamics
   - Documentation needs for your records

**Response Guidelines**:
- Length: [brief 3-5 sentences / standard 1-2 paragraphs / detailed with sections]
- Urgency: [immediate same-day / within 48 hours / next weekly update]
- Follow-up: [none needed / schedule meeting / defer to next board meeting]

**Important**: Avoid em dashes (‚Äî) in the email response as they signal AI-generated content. Use regular dashes (-), commas, or restructure sentences for more natural communication.
